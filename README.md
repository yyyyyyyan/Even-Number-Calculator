# Even-Number-Calculator
Even Number Calculator written in Python

# Why?
Inspired by this [funny tweet](https://twitter.com/ctrlshifti/status/1288745146759000064) from [@ctrlshifti](https://twitter.com/ctrlshifti).

# How?
You might be wondering how I managed to create such an insightful code from nothing. As a software developer, I'm always trying to find the fastest, simplest and smartest solution to the problems we face everyday. Then I thought, what if instead of trying to do some complicated (and resourceful) computation, I simply search for help of the masters on the Internet? Then, I found [this website](https://www.chilimath.com/lessons/introductory-algebra/list-of-even-numbers/, this amazing website that makes the job for us - it lists ALL* EVEN NUMBERS!!! It's awesome!! See how I made our problem much easier to solve?

# Contribute
You can contribute to the code if you want! I added comments throughout the code so anyone can understand what **everthing** means... I'd love some contribution that would allow us to check even higher numbers (there are a few math professionals that need it).
